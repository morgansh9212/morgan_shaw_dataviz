<h1> #MakeoverMonday: Visualizing Vacancy Rates </h1>

<h2> The <a href="https://makeovermonday.co.uk/#:~:text=11-,11/03/2024,-Link">March 11, 2024</a> #MakeoverMonday challenged users to critique and rebuild a visualization used in a LendingTree <a href="https://www.lendingtree.com/home/mortgage/vacant-homes-metros-study/">Article</a> about Household Vacancy Rates in Metros across the US. </h2>
<h3> The article chose to depict the metros with the top 10 highest and lowest vacancy rates in the US using a map. </h3>

The city locations are labeled with orange circles and the states are highlighted in orange. There is a list of the top 10 vacancy rates in the Metros to the side of the map" style="width:80%">

<p>I am rather interested in housing and the topic of Vacancy Rates is often one of<a> href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/08/nyregion/apartment-vacancy-rate-housing-crisis.html"much contention</a>. Further, I am very interested in data visualization using maps and this seemed like a great opportunity to think about how media outlets tend to overuse or misuse maps to tell their story.

<h2> Critique </h2>
<p>
Using Stephen Few's <a href="http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/visual_business_intelligence/data_visualization_effectiveness_profile.pdf"> Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile </a> method, I walked through how this viz attempted to tell the story of Vacancy Rates across the US. Each score is out of 10.
</p>

<h4><b>Usefulness: 4</b></h4>
<p>
While this map (and its [complement](https://www.lendingtree.com/content/uploads/2023/09/Vacancy-Rate-by-Metro_Green-1.jpg) depicting the top 10 lowest Vacancy Rates) told you exactly that, the *top 10 vacancy rates*, it quite literally only showed you that. Of course, if you are only interested in these two facts because you are desperate to put out a tweet about how your city is in the top 10 highest or lowest vacancy rate, then this is sufficient. If you are aiming to gain any understanding of the phenomenon of housing vacancy beyond this fact, this map does very little.
