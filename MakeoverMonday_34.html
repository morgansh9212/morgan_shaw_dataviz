<h1> #MakeoverMonday: Visualizing Vacancy Rates </h1>

<h2> The <a href="https://makeovermonday.co.uk/#:~:text=11-,11/03/2024,-Link">March 11, 2024</a> #MakeoverMonday challenged users to critique and rebuild a visualization used in a  
  <a href="https://www.lendingtree.com/home/mortgage/vacant-homes-metros-study/">LendingTree Article</a> about Household Vacancy Rates in Metros across the US. 
</h2>
<h3> The article chose to depict the metros with the top 10 highest and lowest vacancy rates in the US using a map. </h3>

  I am rather interested in housing and the topic of Vacancy Rates is often one of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/08/nyregion/apartment-vacancy-rate-housing-crisis.html"> much contention</a>. 
  <br> Further, I am very interested in data visualization using maps and this seemed like a great opportunity to think about how media outlets tend to overuse or misuse maps to tell their story. 
</p>
<h2> Critique </h2>
<p>
Using Stephen Few's <a href="http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/visual_business_intelligence/data_visualization_effectiveness_profile.pdf"> Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile </a>
  method, I walked through how this viz attempted to tell the story of Vacancy Rates across the US. <br> Each score is out of 10.
</p>
<h3> Informative</h3>
<h4> Usefulness: 4 </h4>
<p>
While this map (and its <a href="https://www.lendingtree.com/content/uploads/2023/09/Vacancy-Rate-by-Metro_Green-1.jpg"> complement</a>) 
  depicting the top 10 lowest Vacancy Rates) tells you the top 10 vacancy rates, it quite literally <i>only shows you that.</i> 
  Of course, if you are only interested in these two facts then this is sufficient. 
  Top 10 lists are popular and shareable and tend to strike up conversation.<br>
  If you are aiming to gain any understanding of the phenomenon of housing vacancy beyond this fact, you won't be able to glean it from this map. 
</p>
<h4> Completeness: 5 </h4>
  <p>
    The map gives you the information it claims to give you but inexplicably separates the lowest and highest vacancy rates. <br>
    If you were attempting to glean any regional patterns from the figure, you cannot compare the highest and lowest of rates. <br>
    Further, if you wanted to see just how high the highest rate or how low the lowest rate is, this map does not provide any numerical data.
  </p>
<h4> Perceptibility: 6 </h4>
  <p>
    The use of a map only serves to confuse the readers' eye as they look for the top 10. While it shows you where each of the <br>
    cities are in the US, it instead has you searching for the ranking number and it is difficult to rank the cities <br> in any meaningful order without the chart.
  </p>
<h4> Truthfulness: 8 </h4>
  <p>
    It does not attempt to hide any data from the user. It presents you with what it claims to prevent you. <br>
    However, the use of the color orange to depict high vacancy rates is interesting. People familiar with housing policy <br>
    understand that low vacancy rates are associated with 
    <a 
      href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/the-rental-housing-crisis-is-a-supply-problem-that-needs-supply-solutions/#:~:text=Historically%2C%20low%20rental%20vacancy%20rates%20make%20it%20much%20harder%20for%20families%20to%20find%20an%20affordable%20housing"> 
      higher housing costs and rents </a>. 
    A constrained market is much worse <br>
    for renters. Wouldn't that make one think the potentially negative color of orange <br> might be better suited for low vacancy rates?
