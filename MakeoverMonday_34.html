<h1> #MakeoverMonday: Visualizing Vacancy Rates </h1>

<h2> The <a href="https://makeovermonday.co.uk/#:~:text=11-,11/03/2024,-Link">March 11, 2024</a> #MakeoverMonday challenged users to critique and rebuild a visualization used in a  
  <a href="https://www.lendingtree.com/home/mortgage/vacant-homes-metros-study/">LendingTree Article</a> about Household Vacancy Rates in Metros across the US. 
</h2>
<h3> The article chose to depict the metros with the top 10 highest and lowest vacancy rates in the US using a map. </h3>

  I am rather interested in housing and the topic of Vacancy Rates is often one of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/08/nyregion/apartment-vacancy-rate-housing-crisis.html"> much contention</a>. 
  <br> Further, I am very interested in data visualization using maps and this seemed like a great opportunity to think about how media outlets tend to overuse or misuse maps to tell their story. 
</p>
<h2> Critique </h2>
<p>
Using Stephen Few's <a href="http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/visual_business_intelligence/data_visualization_effectiveness_profile.pdf"> Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile </a>
  method, I walked through how this viz attempted to tell the story of Vacancy Rates across the US. <br> Each score is out of 10.
</p>
<h3> <u>Informative</u></h3>
  <p></p>
<h4> Usefulness: 4/10 </h4>
<p>
While this map (and its <a href="https://www.lendingtree.com/content/uploads/2023/09/Vacancy-Rate-by-Metro_Green-1.jpg"> complement</a>) 
  depicting the top 10 lowest Vacancy Rates) tells you the top 10 vacancy rates, it quite literally <i>only shows you that.</i> 
  Of course, if you are only interested in these two facts then this is sufficient. 
  Top 10 lists are popular and shareable and tend to strike up conversation.<br>
  If you are aiming to gain any understanding of the phenomenon of housing vacancy beyond this fact, you won't be able to glean it from this map. 
</p>
<h4> Completeness: 5/10 </h4>
  <p>
    The map gives you the information it claims to give you but inexplicably separates the lowest and highest vacancy rates. <br>
    If you were attempting to glean any regional patterns from the figure, you cannot compare the highest and lowest of rates. <br>
    Further, if you wanted to see just how high the highest rate or how low the lowest rate is, this map does not provide any numerical data.
  </p>
<h4> Perceptibility: 6/10 </h4>
  <p>
    The use of a map only serves to confuse the readers' eye as they look for the top 10. While it shows you where each of the <br>
    cities are in the US, it instead has you searching for the ranking number and it is difficult to rank the cities <br> in any meaningful order without the chart.
  </p>
<h4> Truthfulness: 8/10 </h4>
  <p>
    It does not attempt to hide any data from the user. It presents you with what it claims to prevent you. <br>
    However, the use of the color orange to depict high vacancy rates is interesting. People familiar with housing policy <br>
    understand that low vacancy rates are associated with 
    <a 
      href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/the-rental-housing-crisis-is-a-supply-problem-that-needs-supply-solutions/#:~:text=Historically%2C%20low%20rental%20vacancy%20rates%20make%20it%20much%20harder%20for%20families%20to%20find%20an%20affordable%20housing"> 
      higher housing costs and rents </a>. 
    A constrained market is much worse <br>
    for renters. Wouldn't that make one think the potentially negative color of orange might be better suited for low vacancy rates?
  </p>
<h4> Intuitiveness: 7 </h4>
  <p>
    The map is very easy to understand, even if it can be a bit confusing to look through. <br> 
    The clear title and simple concept mean it is very easy to read.
  </p>
<h3> <u>Emotive</u> </h3>
<h4> Aesthetics: 6 </h4>
  <p>
    Very simple aesthetics and clean use of colors. The font is very legible and gray is used well. 
  </p>
<h4> Engagement: 5 </h4>
  <p>
    The colors and the map do draw your eye in, but there is not much substance to the visualization so one quickly loses interest.

<h2>
Sketching a New Vizualization
</h2>
<p>
  I first did a hand sketch on a new way to represent the data in a map. <br>
  <img src="IMG_0019.jpg"
    alt="Hand drawn map of US with blue and orange circles to represent metros. The circles are of slightly different size to represent metro size.
    There is a hand drawn legend showing 1% as low and orange and blue as high."
    style="width:80%">
<br>
  I first thought of how I could potentially show high and low vacancy metros on the same map to help the viewer see more regional, spatial patterns.
  I also thought it would be helpful to see how vacancy and metro size correlated. By using the included Total Housing Units Data, I figured I could show how population size and vacancy rate interacted.
<br>
  I built a map fairly quickly in Tableau to try and demonstrate this. 
<img src="Screenshot 2024-09-18 203844.png"
  alt="Map built in Tableau with dark background, orange circles representing low vacancy and blue circles representing high vacancy. The circles change size with increasing total amounts of housing units" 
  style="width:70%">
I chose to portray it as a diverging color scheme and use circles that increase with size as the total number of housing units increases. 
</p>
<h3>
  Testing the Sketch
</h3>
  <p>
    I showed my sketch to two people. I asked them the following questions:
    1. Look at the visualization for about 10 seconds. What do you immediately notice?
    2. After this initial reaction, look it over for the next 30 seconds to a minute. Broadly, what do you think this map is?
    3. What news story would you expect to see this map in?
    4. Is there anything you wish this map told you? 
    5. Do you dislike anything about the map?
Some key feedback I got from these interviews was to reduce the amount of cities depicted on the map. As there was such a large range of cities represented, metros with only 20,000 units seemed out of place with cities as large as 8 million units.
    Further, I got some more feedback to make sure the colors I used were easy to distinguish, especially the oranges. 
    The story I was trying to tell seemed to get across to my audience, but people wanted some more context for the vacancy numbers. They understood that orange/dark orange were bad, but they wanted to know what the comparison would be.
    In-Class critique gave similar comments. One thing that was pointed out was that this map actually gave a good feel for the <i>regional</i> effects of vacancy rates.

<h2>
  Final Re-Visualization
</h2>
  <p>
  I incorporated many of the suggestions I got during testing into a new tableau dashboard.

                                                                                                             var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    
                                                                                                             scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    
                                                                                                             vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);                </script>

  I made sure the oranges were easy to distinguish, this very much helped to make sure people could tell the difference between the very low and moderately low vacancy rates. <br> <br>
  I reduced the cities to only those with 200,000 units or more and this cleaned up the visual substantially. <br> <br>
  I used the caption space and title to give some more context for the viz. <br> <br>

  <h3> Overall, I am quite proud of how it turned out!
