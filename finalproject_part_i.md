## Eviction and the Right To Counsel

While I was looking for a data viz to critique for my [previous assignment](MakeoverMonday_34.html), I saw that one of the vizualizations put forth by Matthew Desmond's [Eviction Lab](evictionlab.org) was put up for a redesign. 
While I ended up choosing a dataset focused on vacancy rates, I spent several minutes scouring the wealth of research on eviction they've produced and provided to the public for free. 
Matthew Desmond's *Evicted* (2016) tells the stories of landlords and tenants in Milwaukee, WI and how eviction harms the most vulnerable people in society. 
Whether it is older men on SSI and unable to work being forced onto the street or children struggling to succeed in school because of frequent moves, they are all hurt by eviction.

Their mapping of eviction shows how widespread this damaging practice is.
